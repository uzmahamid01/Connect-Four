# Connect Four : Java AI Implementation

This repository contains the source code for a classic Connect Four game implemented in Java. Developed as a final project for an OOP class, this project features:

### Two-player gameplay: Compete against a human opponent or two AI variants.
Challenging AI: The "thoughtful AI" utilizes a basic implementation of the minimax algorithm, prioritizing blocking opponent wins, securing its own wins, and strategically planning moves.
Customization: Choose from a "random AI" for a lighter challenge or test your skills against the "thoughtful AI".

### Key Features:

Object-oriented design principles applied
Board representation and manipulation logic
Human and AI turn handling
Winning condition detection
"Thoughtful AI" with a basic minimax implementation for strategic moves
"Random AI" for a casual challenge
